# intus
Modeling integrated urban systems

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

  - intus is a python-based model of integrated urban systems where the city is represented as a grid
  - Four different layers of urban complexity are modeled: urban growth, socio-economic status, energy demand and environmental impact
  - Urban growth is simulated using a cellular automata approach based on the well-known SLEUTH model
  - The socio-economic status is determined based on the value of land calculated using relevant layers of environmental characteristics
  - A bottom-up model is used for the calculation of energy demand and the corresponding environmental impact


## Requirements
Python 2.7 (installation with Anaconda recommended)
